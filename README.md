At the moment, Octokit lite has the following functionalities:
- [Unfork](#unfork)  <img width='24' src='public/unfork_logo.png' /> â€” identify all the forks that you have made over the _months_ or _years_ and **unfork** them all!
- (coming soon!) HacktoberfestLah â€” a handy tool for project maintainers to apply the `Hacktoberfest` topic to all the repositories that you want!

## Unfork

GitHub forks tend to be created for the following reasons:
1. Following tutorials ðŸ“–
1. Contributing to open source projects ðŸ’»
1. GitHub automatically forking stuff for you when you just wanted to view the source code for a particular file of a project ðŸ˜†

After months and years, usually these forks still stay in your repository â€” and that's because of how _inconvenient_ it is to identify and delete the many forks that you have made.

Unfork helps you to solve that problem **easily** âœ¨

### Features

- [x] View your repository count.
- [x] You can choose what repos to delete before actually deleting them.
- [x] View what the forks that you have deleted.
- [ ] Allow users to filter forks by inactivity level (e.g. last repo commit date/their last personal commit date to the repo)
- [ ] Generates an optional shell command for you to run to backup all the forks that you are going to delete before deleting them.
