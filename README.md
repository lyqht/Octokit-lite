At the moment, Octokit lite has the following functionalities:
- [Unfork](#unfork) <img width='24' src='public/unfork_logo.png' /> â€” identify all the forks that you have made over the _months_ or _years_ and **unfork** them all!
- [TopicSpace](#topicspace) <img width='24' src='public/topicspace_logo.svg' /> â€” a handy tool for project maintainers to add topic(s) to all the repositories that you want!

## Unfork

Delete repositories easily with Unfork.

<details><summary>Idea behind Unfork</summary>
GitHub forks tend to be created for the following reasons:
1. Following tutorials ðŸ“–
2. Contributing to open source projects (especially during [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)!) ðŸ’»
3. GitHub automatically forking stuff for you when you just wanted to view the source code for a particular file of a project ðŸ˜†

After months and years, usually these forks still stay in your repository â€” and that's because of how _inconvenient_ it is to identify and delete the many forks that you have made.

Unfork helps you to solve that problem **easily** âœ¨
